# Bioinformatics and chemoinformatics scripts

These are some scripts which I made during my studies of Bioinformatics at
[University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague](http://www.vscht.cz/?jazyk=en).
I have only chosen the ones which I think they can help someone to understand
or implement some bioinformatics algorithms.

They are mainly written in `Python 3`. Currently I am attending the course
*Analysis of gene expression* where we use the `R` programming language so 
maybe in future I will also add here some `R` scripts.
